                 <p class="__abomi1 ">The product is a  <a href="https://chemicalsafetyfacts.org/chlorine-dioxide/">Chlorine Dioxide</a>    . <br>
                 it has been in use in Europe, America and in developed <br>
                 countries all over the world to sterilize and treat their water and household use.<br>

                 <p class="__abomi ">percentage</p>
                 <p class="__abomi1 ">0.1%</p>
                 <p class="__abomi ">storage</p>
                 <p class="__abomi1 ">The product should be stored in a cool dark place. <br>Cannnot withstand exposure to direct sunlight.
                  Expiration.<br>
                  when the lemongreen changes to white, kindly discard as it is no longer<br> useful for consumption</p>
                  
                 <p class="__abomi ">Quality / Attribute</p>


                 <p class="__abomi1 ">Chlorine dioxide is an approved disinfectant for drinking water and offers the following advantages in comparison:</p>
 
<p class="__abomi ">Ozonation and UV irradiation</p>
 
<p class="__abomi1 ">Very cost and energy intensive process, continuous power supply necessary
 
Rapid decomposition of the ozone and low penetration and radiation in containers and pipes, therefore no adequate, only short-term sterilization possible, resuscitation quickly possible
</p>
<p class="__abomi ">Sodium Hypochlorite</p>
 
<p class="__abomi1 ">Lower disinfecting power compared to chlorine dioxide - chlorine dioxide is up to 20 times stronger than sodium hypochlorite, the oxidation potential of the sodium hypochlorite is lower, therefore, various dissolved impurities are not split, which can cause a change in taste of the water when using sodium hypochlorite,
insufficient degradation of biofilms, risk of faster re-germination,
the dosage is higher and requires a longer exposure time compared to chlorine dioxide</p>



<p class="__abomi ">Chlorine dioxide</p>
 
<p class="__abomi1 ">Versatile disinfectant works against bacteria, fungi, spores, yeasts, viruses and algae,

very short exposure time and strong disinfection performance,
pH-independent effect and thus constant disinfection (the pH values of different waters often fluctuate).

Degradation of biofilms and deposits in pipe networks and containers, the reintroduction of germs is greatly reduced.
Odors and flavors in the water through algae, will be neutralized. 

No reaction with organic dissolved substances, which could lead to a change in the taste of the water.
Strong oxidizing power and thus modification and reduction of water constituents such as iron, manganese, amines and humic substances.

Degradation of the chlorine dioxide solutions to sodium chloride (common salt) and water and thus to be disposed of by self-decomposition without problems,
No expensive system technology required, manual dosing and independent of power supply.</p>

<p class="__abomi ">Purpose of chlorine dioxide</p>
<p class="__abomi1 ">
•	Removal of biofilms in domestic water installations and prevention of 
	recontamination,<br>
•	Disinfection of brewing water, filter systems, drinking water and washing water 
	for agricultural products,<br>
•	Cleaning and disinfecting drinking and well water, bath water<br>
•	Cleaning of bottle, sterilization of bottle rinsing water,<br>
•	Sterilization of cooling circuits,<br>
•	Keeping tankers clean for transporting water and food,<br>
•	Keep floors, work surfaces and equipment clean in medical practices<br>
•	Eliminate mold and algae etc.<br>
•	Disinfection and detoxification of wastewater, odor removal by oxidation of the 
causative substances such as fermentation gases, urea, ammonia, dissolved    amines.<br>
•	Detoxification by oxidation of cyanides and nitrate in water / wastewater,<br>
•	Oxidation of iron, manganese and dissolved metals in water / wastewater</p>>

<p class="__abomi ">Disinfection / Dosage</p>


<p class="__abomi1 ">All tanks, pipes etc. , which lead water, germinate with time and it forms the so-called biofilm in which microbes live and contaminate the stored water there.

Therefore, all water-bearing containers must be cleaned regularly - the so-called basic or disinfection must be performed.

It should be done at least once or twice a year, or if water contamination is suspected or biofilm is suspected (usually slimy deposits on the surfaces).

The dosage of chlorine dioxide solution is calculated from the volumes in liters of the water-carrying systems and the recommended dosing instructions ml of chlorine dioxide solution / liter of water.

The dosage in the disinfection is significantly higher than the permitted concentration of chlorine dioxide in drinking water, it is based on 5mg chlorine dioxide / liter /, in case of heavy infestation with biofilm is a higher concentration to choose -ca.10-20 mg chlorine dioxide / liter of water.

The water used for disinfecting the stand must be discarded or used for washing the clothes, for cleaning or for toilet flushing.

The finished chlorine dioxide solution should be carefully pouredin a half full tank and then fill the tank completely with water. If possible, all parts should be touched with water to achieve complete cleaning. All taps are to be opened briefly so that they too are flushed through. After approx. 3 hours exposure, open all taps once again and let drain some water.

After 12 - 24 h exposure time, the water can be removed, the biofilm is dead and gradually falls off, germs are destroyed.

Now fresh water can be filled, which is to be treated according to the regulations for the treatment of drinking water with chlorine dioxide solution.

See MIMA dosing instructions!

With each new filling of the containers / tanks with new fresh water / drinking water, ready-to-use chlorine dioxide solution must be added (see dosing instructions MIMA Water Cleanser) in order to maintain the basic disinfection of the water.
</p>



<p class="__abomi ">Dosage recommendations:</p>

<p class="__abomi1 ">Dosage MIMA Water Cleanser 74 solution<br>

1.	Basic disinfection of water pipes, tanks ect. 50ml / 10 liters of water<br>
2.	For heavy contaminants of water-bearing systems 100ml / 10 liters of water<br>
3.	Disinfection of wells 100ml / 10 liters of water<br>
4.	Disinfection of waste water 100ml / 10 liters of water<br>
5.	Wash water for cleaning work surfaces etc. 40ml / 10 liters of water<br>
6.	Disinfection of well water 3ml / 10 liters of water<br>
7.	Disinfection of drinking water 10 ml / 50 liters of water<br>

The recommended use of chlorine dioxide solutions may be subject to fluctuations, depending on the degree of pollution and dissolved constituents of the raw water, as well as temperature and solar radiation contribute to the reduction of reactive chlorine dioxide.

When used in drinking water, after the chlorine dioxide has reacted, the limit value of 0.2 mg chlorine dioxide / liter water should not be exceeded or the recommended lower value of 0.05 mg ChlO2 / liter water should not be exceeded.
